  shared-idp:
    name: Shared IdP
    def: An Identity Provider (IdP) is a service that stores, maintains, and manages digital identities to authenticate users logging into an application. The API Services Portal uses a Shared IdP, which is a centralized BC Government IdP (SSO Gold-tier Keycloak cluster) that manages credentials and user access. The Shared IdP enables entities (APIs, applications, websites, and services) to access secured digital identities to control authentication and authorization. By using a Shared IdP, the API Services Portal enables API providers to delegate the responsibility of authentication and authorization to their chosen IdP (including IDIR, BC Services Card, GitHub ID).

  yaml-file:
    name: YAML File
    def: YAML is a computer language used to create simple-to-read configuration files. The API Services Portal can use YAML files to store and publish configuration for all object types (for example, Gateway Services, Datasets, Products, etc.). YAML is structured using indents and minimal punctuation marks, and usually has a file extension of `.yaml` or `.yml`.
