title: {Production Readiness Checklist}
---

This guide gives
{{ glossary_tooltip term_id="api-provider" text="API Providers" }} a quick
reference of actions they need to complete before publishing their Gateway
Services to the {{ glossary_tooltip term_id="api-directory" }}.

## First time activities

- Learn about and understand the benefits of the [API Services Portal](https://api.gov.bc.ca)
  by reviewing our [plain language](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/finding-and-sharing/api-management)
  and [technical documentation](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/aps-infra-platform-docs/).
  Reach out to the APS team by opening a [support ticket](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/2)
  or on our [Rocket.Chat](https://docs.developer.gov.bc.ca/join-bc-rocket-chat/)
  channel (#aps-ops) if you can’t find the information you’re looking for.

- Have access to a production-ready API. This could be a public or private
  service. If your API service runs on BC Government [Platform Service’s](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/)
  Silver or Gold Private OpenShift clusters, you will need to configure the network
  policies to allow access from your API gateway. View our
  [Set Up an Upstream Service](/how-to/upstream-services.md)
  guide for more information.

- Get Organizational approval to share your API services. Comply with your
  Organization’s information management and security guidelines. For BC
  Government, this includes but is not limited to [Privacy Impact Assessments](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy/privacy-impact-assessments)
  (PIA) and [Security Threat and Risk Assessments](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/information-security/security-threat-and-risk-assessment)
  (STRA).

- **Optional**: Document your API in an [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)
  (OAS, formerly Swagger).

## Configure a Gateway Service

- [Install the `gwa` CLI](/how-to/gwa-install.md).

- Create a [Gateway](/how-to/create-gateway.md) and [Gateway Service](/how-to/create-gateway-service.md).

## Protect your API

Ensure that your Gateway Services are protected to safeguard your APIs and the
data they handle.

- Implement [authentication](/how-to/client-cred-flow) to control who can
  interact with your services.

- Manage [consumer access](/how-to/api-access) and configure rate limiting to
  prevent abuse of your resources.

## Share your API

Package your Gateway Services and make them available for discovery by
developers and consumers in BC Government and beyond.

- Author a [Dataset](/how-to/api-discovery.md/#create-a-dataset) with metadata
  about your API. If your API is already listed in the BC Data Catalogue, you
  can skip this step.

- Bundle your Gateway Services into a [Product](/how-to/api-discovery.md/#link-your-dataset-to-a-product).

- Associate your Gateway with an Organization and Business Unit.

- Preview your Product on the API Directory and enable it for discovery in the
  API Services Portal.

## Additional steps

These steps are not required to enable your Gateway Services for discovery but
may be useful for Gateway administrators.

### Integrate DevOps

- Learn how to keep your Gateway Services updated by
[adding the `gwa` CLI  to existing CI/CD pipelines](/how-to/cicd-integration.md)

### Monitor your Gateway Services

- Understand how to [view request metrics](/how-to/monitoring.md) in real-time
  for your Gateway Services
