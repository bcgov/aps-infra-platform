## Use the Access Approval Process

Enable `approval` for an Environment and act as Access Manager, reviewing
requests and approving access to your APIs.

## Manage Access and Controls

> NOTE: To manage access to your APIs, you must have the `Access.Manage`
> permission for the Gateway.

As an Access Manager, you can manage new Consumers by going to the **Gateways**
tab, selecting a **Gateway**, and clicking the **Consumers** card.

Here you should see the newly created Consumer. Click on the `name` in the
**Name/ID** column to view **Consumer Details** and **Products** they have
access to.

You can administer **Controls** such as rate limiting and IP restrictions.

You can administer **Authorization** by toggling access to the particular
Product and Environment.
