<!-- overview -->

This guide explains how to get help with the API Services Portal and outlines
our support hours and channels.

## Support hours

Support is available during business hours, 8:30 am to 4:30 pm Pacific Time,
Monday to Friday, for all teams using the platform. During these hours, you can
reach out via [Rocket.Chat](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/aps-ops)
or our [Support Portal](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/2).

Extended/out-of-hours support is available 24/7 for API providers running
critical services with geo-redundancy. The cost of providing this service is
shared equally between all teams with a Service Level Agreement that includes
extended support. Teams with extended support should reach out via the Extended
Support Portal.
