# Resources

The following resources are provided as references and for guidance on APIs, including information on how to design APIs, follow good patterns, and ensure consistency and structure.

- [Government of Canada API Store](https://api.canada.ca/): The API store for the Government of Canada is a one-stop shop for APIs to build applications and services using government data and information. The API Store is the central repository of Federal government department APIs. The API Store enables discovery of APIs, ensures consistent security, provides performance and analytics information, and offers guidance on API life cycle management.

- [BC Government API Guidelines (DevHub)](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Data-and-APIs/BC-Government-API-Guidelines): The purpose of these guidelines is to promote consistency and provide guidance around the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) across the BC government, and to enable exchange and integration of data between systems, agencies, businesses and citizens.

- [OpenAPI Initiative](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/): The OpenAPI Initiative guideâ€™s focus is on HTTP-based API designers and writers who want to have their API formalized in an OpenAPI Description document. The description document is a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs based on the OpenAPI Specification (OAS).
