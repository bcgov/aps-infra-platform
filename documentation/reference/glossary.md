|Term|Definition|
|:----|:----|
|Access Control|Access control is a set of security measures that regulate who can access a system, services, data, or resource. Access control policies use authentication and authorization to verify users and enable access.|
|Access Token|Access tokens enable clients to securely call protected APIs. The APIs use the access tokens to perform authentication and authorization. The information in the access token verifies that a user is entitled to access an API.|
|API|An Application Programming Interface (API) is a software-to-software interface that provides a secure and standardized way for applications to communicate with each other to deliver requested data without user intervention.|
|API Consumer|API Consumers (organizations providing services to end-users) use APIs in the delivery of their services. API Consumers integrate the APIs into their applications.|
|API Directory|Our API Directory is a centralized repository where API Providers can securely publish their APIs. API Consumers can find and request access to published APIs for integration in the API Directory.|
|API Gateway  | An API Gateway is a service that acts as a single entry point for multiple APIs, managing requests, routing, security, and other operations, simplifying and centralizing API management.|
|API Key|A unique identifier used to authenticate a client application accessing an API. The API Key is included in each API request and used to identify the application and authorize the request.  |
|API Program Services (APS)|API Program Services (APS) is the team responsible for delivering services that enable ongoing access to public sector data by providing support for managing APIs in BC Government. APS ensures the efficient management of APIs through the API Services Portal.|
|API Provider|An API Provider, usually a developer, is someone who creates, publishes, operates, and maintains APIs in the API Management Platform.|
|API Management Platform|The API Management Platform is an overarching service that enables data providers to manage their APIs. It includes the API Services Portal and API Directory.|
|API Services Portal|The API Services Portal is the access point for API Providers and Consumers to publish, discover, and manage APIs. It is built using the open-source Kong Gateway and includes  tools to provide API security, authentication, routing, and publishing.  The API Services Portal enables API Providers to build, configure, and share their APIs publicly or privately.|
|Authentication|Authentication is a security process for verifying the identity of a user or device before allowing access to a system, resource, or function. Authentication validates that a user or system is who they claim to be.|
|Authorization|Authorization is a security process for providing a user or device with access to a requested system, resource, or function based on permissions. Authorization is provided only after a user or device has been authenticated.|
|Client|In the context of an API, a client refers to a software application or system that accesses the functionality provided by the API. Clients send requests to and receive responses from the API.|
|Client Secret|A confidential code shared between a client application and the authorization server to generate an access token. Used in an OAuth Client Credentials flow, which enhances security by validating client identity.|
|Environment|An environment in software development is the collection of hardware and software a system uses to run applications and services.<br> These include development, testing, and production environments: <br> The development environment is the workspace to design, program, and change the application or system. <br> The test environment simulates the final live environment but is isolated to not affect live systems. Teams use this environment to conduct test cases, test code and updates, and identify bugs or defects and review fixes. This ensures the quality and functionality of the application or system. <br> The production environment is where the application or system is in operation and available to end-users.|
|gwa Command Line Interface|The `gwa` command line interface (CLI) is a tool for creating and publishing Gateway Services and other resources on the API Management Portal. Resources are defined in YAML configuration files. The `gwa` CLI helps support automated Gateway management through scripting.    |
|Kong Gateway|Kong Gateway is an open-source, cloud-native API gateway. It is the centralized entry point for managing and securing APIs, and controlling access, traffic, and data transformation. When API Providers configure API Gateways for their services, these Gateways are enforced through Kong.|
|Namespace|A namespace is a collection of Kong Gateway Services and Routes, generally managed by a single team or business unit.|
|Organization|An organization is any ministry, crown corporation, or agency within the B.C. Government.|
|Organization Administrator|An Organization Administrator (Org Admin) is the user responsible for monitoring and managing all APIs for a specific organization on the API Services Portal. The Org Admin’s primary responsibility is to allow an API provider to publish an API to the API Directory.|
|Publish|Publishing APIs is the process by which an API Provider makes their API publicly available in the API Directory for discovery by API Consumers.|
|Rate Limit   |A way to restrict how many times a user, bot, or application can access an API in a given timeframe. Rate limiting is important for preventing malicious attacks.|
|Role|A role is a group of predefined access permissions assigned to a user.|
|Route|A route is a means of exposing a service to users. It is the path used to send requests to its respective service after reaching the Gateway. A single service can have multiple routes.|
|Service|A service represents an external upstream API or microservice consisting of a URL, which listens for incoming requests.|
|Scope|Scope is a method used to specify authorization, or a set of permissions that grant access to specified systems and actions. Scopes can be applied to both users and service accounts.|
|Shared IdP|An Identity Provider (IdP) is a service that stores, maintains, and manages digital identities to authenticate users logging into an application. The API Services Portal uses a Shared IdP, which is a centralized BC Government IdP (SSO Gold-tier Keycloak cluster) that manages credentials and user access. The Shared IdP enables entities (APIs, applications, websites, and services) to access secured digital identities to control authentication and authorization. By using a Shared IdP, the API Services Portal enables API providers to delegate the responsibility of authentication and authorization to their chosen IdP (including IDIR, BC Services Card, GitHub ID).|
|YAML File|YAML is a computer language used to create simple-to-read configuration files. The API Services Portal can use YAML files to store and publish configuration for all object types (for example, Gateway Services, Datasets, Products, etc.). YAML is structured using indents and minimal punctuation marks, and usually has a file extension of `.yaml` or `.yml`.    |
