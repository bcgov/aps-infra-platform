# API Services Portal Release 1.2.14

The API Services Portal has been updated with a new feature and some bug fixes. 

## Features
**GWA-CLI V2**
* Gateway Command Line Interface Version 2 (GWA-CLI V2) is a new and improved command line interface to use when configuring your API Gateway settings. Improvements include:
  * Improved onboarding experience 
  * Ability to create a namespace from the command line 
  * Templates for using common authorization patterns on the API Gateway 


## Fixes
* There was a bug that displayed inactive environments in the portal. We now filter out inactive environments from the drop down menu. 
* Some changes to the BC Data Catalogue were not being reflected in the APS Portal. This has been resolved so all datasets are synced with the BC Data Catalogue.
