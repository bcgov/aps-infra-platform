# API Services Portal Release 1.2.20

The API Services Portal has been updated with an enhancement and bug fix.

## Enhancements
-	Added the Application and Application Owner as metadata to the Consumer record so that it is available in the enhanced analytics. Addresses [#980](https://github.com/bcgov/api-services-portal/issues/980).
-	Added the ability to hide a two-tiered access setup in the API Directory. Instructions are provided in our [documentation](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/aps-infra-platform-docs/gateway/COMMON-CONFIG/#two-tiered-access-setup).

## Fixes
-	Improve Markdown rendering in Dataset details on the API Directory.
