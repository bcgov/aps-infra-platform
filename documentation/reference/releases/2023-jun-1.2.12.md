# API Services Portal Release 1.2.12

The API Services Portal has been updated with a new feature, enhancements, and bug fixes.

## Features

[#518](https://github.com/bcgov/api-services-portal/issues/518) - Private Key : Added a way for clients to provide a public certificate while requesting access, and a self-serve way to update your public certificate.

## Enhancements

[#773](https://github.com/bcgov/api-services-portal/issues/773) - When configuring environment services, you can drag and drop your "available services" into "active services". We added more UI feedback to this screen, so it is clear when you have dragged something into the "active services" area.

## Fixes

[#785](https://github.com/bcgov/api-services-portal/issues/785) - In the APS portal, the Help menu contained the wrong link to the release notes page. The Help menu now contains the correct link.

[#789](https://github.com/bcgov/api-services-portal/issues/789) - There was a bug that incorrectly displayed the logged in user as the owner of an Authorization Profile, even if they were not. This has been fixed, and the correct owner of the Authorization Profile is always displayed.
