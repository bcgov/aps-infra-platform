  to the API Directory. Addresses [#983](https://github.com/bcgov/api-services-portal/issues/983).

## Enhancements

- Updated automated testing to use the latest versions of Cypress (13.6.3) and the gwa-cli (2.0.15).

## Fixes

- Minor UI fixes, including:
  - Relocated Request Access button for tiered access.
  - Updated Help menu. Addressed in [#995](https://github.com/bcgov/api-services-portal/pull/995).

Alongside this Portal release, we have also officially migrated our documentation
to the new [DevHub  MVP site](https://mvp.developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/aps-infra-platform-docs/).
Our previous documentation page will no longer be updated, so be sure to update your bookmarks.
