# API Services Portal Release 3.0.5

The API Services Portal has been updated with enhancements to improve the API
provider experience. The key change is the upgrade of Kong from version 2.8.5 to 3.9.

## Enhancements

* Kong
  * Upgraded from version 2.8.5 to 3.9.
  * This upgrade enhances security and reliability, offers additional flexibility
    with plugins, and provides significant performance enhancements.
  * Route paths that use regular expressions are no longer automatically detected. 
    For Kong to parse paths that contain a regular expression, the path must be 
    prefixed with a ~. All paths that do not start with ~ will be considered plain 
    text, meaning any regular expressions will no longer function. For more
    information, see the [Kong 3 Transition Guide](/unlisted/kong3-upgrade.md).
* API Services Portal
  * Updated feeder with new Prometheus metric queries for Kong 3.
* `gwa-api`
  * Upgraded deck version to support Kong 3.
