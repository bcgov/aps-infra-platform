# API Services Portal Release 1.2.4

The API Services Portal has been updated with a new feature, some enhancements, and some bug fixes. 

**Features** 

- API Providers can search past activity in a Namespace, enabling them to better serve clients and help troubleshoot issues. 
 
**Enhancements**

- Improved design considerations were added to pages with no data currently available to display. 
- The design of the Namespace Access section for API managers has been refreshed;  enhancements include grouping by access roles, inline search, and sortable tables. 

**Fixes** 

- When viewing the details of a request, the “approver” shows as the name of the individual who sent the request, rather than the name of the individual who approved the request. A fix has been applied to display the correct requestor and approver names. 
- All API Consumer names were displaying with the @idir domain, even if the API Consumer’s identity provider was different. A fix has been applied to display the correct identity provider. 
- Several formatting and sorting issues on the consumers page have been corrected.
