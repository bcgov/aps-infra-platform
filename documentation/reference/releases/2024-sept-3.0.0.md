# API Services Portal Release 3.0.0

The API Services Portal has been updated with enhancements in the existing features.

## Enhancements

* The term 'Namespace' is now renamed to 'Gateway'.
  * Across all our products, every mention of 'Namespace' (which refers to the
    container used to hold a collection of Kong Gateway Services and Routes,
    typically managed by a single team or business unit) has been updated to
    'Gateway'.
  * All existing Namespaces will be retained but will now be referred to as Gateways.
  * The only remaining trace of Namespace is the `ns.` prefix required in tags
    for Gateway Service configuration (`tags: [ ns.<gatewayId> ]`).
* Gateways now feature a customizable display name.
  * This display name is prominently displayed throughout the API Services Portal.
  * For existing Namespaces, the default display name will be `<IDIR>'s Gateway`.
* The Namespace `name` attribute has been renamed to `gatewayId` for Gateways.
  * This change aims to prevent confusion between `gatewayId` and the new
    `displayName` attribute for Gateways.
  * The gatewayId is still used for setting the current Gateway in the CLI (`gwa
    config set gateway <gatewayId>`) and in tags within Gateway Service
    configuration (`tags: [ ns.<gatewayId> ]`).
* Gateway selection user interface has changed.
  * A new **My Gateways** page has been added, featuring a searchable list of Gateways.
  * The Gateway dropdown selector has been relocated and updated. It now appears
    only on relevant API provider pages.
* New starting page for new users after API provider login.
  * Users without any Gateways are directed to <https://api.gov.bc.ca/manager/gateways/get-started>.
  * This page provides a basic introduction and instructions for the new Quick
    Start tutorial for API providers.
  * The new Quick Start tutorial offers a simpler option to begin with before
    progressing to the [Protect an API with Client Credential Flow](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/aps-infra-platform-docs/tutorials/protect-client-cred/)
    tutorial (previously called Quick Start).
  * The revised Quick Start tutorial utilizes a new `quick-start` configuration template.
* Additional Changes:
  * Added breadcrumbs on Gateway management pages.
  * **Gateways** is no longer visible in the navigation bar for non-IDIR users
    (BCeID, BC Services Card, GitHub).
  * The **Namespace Access** page is renamed to **Administration Access**.

## GWA-CLI V3

Gateway Command Line Interface Version 3 (GWA-CLI V3.0.1) is a new and enhanced
tool for configuring your API Gateway settings. Key improvements include:

* Capability to create a gateway directly from the command line.
* New default behaviour (`gwa gateway create`) is to autogenerate a unique
  `gatewayId` and prompt for a custom display name.
* The `--gateway-id` and `--display-name` flags can be used to specify these attributes.
* Improvements to error reporting for Gateway Service publication (`gwa apply`
  and `gwa publish-gateway`). Additional error messaging is shown by default to
  support troubleshooting.
* Improvements to Gateway Service configuration creation using templates (`gwa
  generate-config`). Gateway `service` and `route` names are validated for
  availability during configuration creation.
* Templates for implementing common authorization patterns on the API Gateway.
