# API Services Portal Release 3.0.0

The API Services Portal has been updated with an important enhancement to improve
performance, stability, and security. Several minor bugs and UI improvements
have also been addressed.

## Enhancements

* **Upgraded Node.js runtime** from v16 to v22 to improve performance, ensure
  compatibility with modern dependencies, and address potential security
  vulnerabilities.
 
## `gwa` CLI 3.0.6

The `gwa` command line tool has been updated with two fixes:

* Interactive mode for `gwa generate-config` does not prompt for Organization or
  Organization Unit. You can still specify them by editing th generated
  configuration file.
* Improved terminal output compatibility with Windows.
