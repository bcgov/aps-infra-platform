# Backend updates

Several bugs in our backend services have been resolved.

## Bugs

- **`gwa status` works with upstream services on Silver and Emerald** - Refactored this command to properly check the status of upstream services hosted on the Silver and Emerald clusters.
- **API provider Grafana session duration** - Grafana session will expire after 10 hours alongside the metrics authentication. This will eliminate 'Access Denied' errors when trying to access the Grafana dashboards.
- **Forwards compatibility for Kong 3 route paths** - Kong 3 introduces a breaking change to the route path format, in which regex paths require a tilde (`~`) prefix. To ensure API provider readiness for this upgrade, warnings will be issued when publishing incompatible routes. More information can be found in our [Kong 3 Transition Guide](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/aps-infra-platform-docs/reference/kong3-upgrade/).
