The API Services Portal has been updated with enhancements to existing features.

**Redesign of the user interface for Providers to manage Consumers**

- User experience improvements have been made to how providers review, approve, or reject an access request
- Providers can assign labels to a Consumer, so that the Consumer can be searched by a label in the future
- Providers can filter Consumers by products, environments, labels, scopes, and roles. These filters allow Providers to easily categorize and find Consumers
- Providers can create labels for a Consumer when approving a Consumer’s access
- Providers can edit a consumer’s labels
- Providers can review the access a Consumer has, to determine if the access is appropriate
- Providers can grant additional access to an existing Consumer, in limited circumstances
