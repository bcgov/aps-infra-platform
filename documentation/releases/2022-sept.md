# API Services Portal Release 1.2.3


The API Services Portal has been updated with a new feature: 

**Integration with BC Services Card**

API consumers can now use BC Services Card for login authentication.
Note: Authentication options are not interchangeable. If you choose to use BC Services Card, and were previously using an alternative authentication method (such as Business BCeID, GitHub, or IDIR), your existing accountâ€™s settings and services will not be linked. We suggest that you continue using your original authentication credential.
