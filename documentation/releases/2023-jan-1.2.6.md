# API Services Portal Release 1.2.6

The API Services Portal has been updated with new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

## New Features

- **Shared IdP**:
  - This feature allows API Providers to leverage the SSO Gold-tier Keycloak cluster to manage Client Credentials without having to deal directly with the cluster. The APS team has a custom realm on this Keycloak cluster called apigw, which is administered by the API Services Portal. To use it, [follow these steps](<[url](https://bcgov.github.io/aps-infra-platform/guides/tutorial-idp-client-cred-flow/#shared-idp)>).
- **Private Routing**:
  - This feature allows API Providers to make private API endpoints, which can have security benefits. [Learn more here](<[url](https://bcgov.github.io/aps-infra-platform/guides/owner-journey/#private-routing)>).
- **New Plugins**
  - [Waiting Queue](https://bcgov.github.io/aps-infra-platform/gateway/plugins/waiting-queue/#waiting-queue): Support Waiting Queue solutions, such as [https://github.com/bcgov/WaitingQueue](https://github.com/bcgov/WaitingQueue).
  - [Kong Upstream Auth Basic](https://bcgov.github.io/aps-infra-platform/gateway/plugins/kong-upstream-auth-basic/#kong-upstream-auth-basic): Kong Plugin to add HTTP Basic Authentication to the upstream request header.
- Edit an application
  - API Consumers can now edit their existing applications in the portal.
