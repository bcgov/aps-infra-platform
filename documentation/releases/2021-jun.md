# API Services Portal BETA is Live!

We are happy to announce that the API Services Portal has been released into Production.

A few notable points:

- The following applications have reached end-of-life and are now demised:

  - **ARGG**: If you would like to publish an API, please follow the steps in the API Owner User Journey.
  - **KQ**: Requesting access to APIs is now done via the [Directory](/devportal/api-discovery) page on the API Services Portal.
  - **API Keys**: API Keys provides a way for developers to generate API Keys for access to BC Gov APIs in non-production environments. This is now done via the [Directory](/devportal/api-discovery) page on the API Services Portal.

> There will be a period of time where **API Keys** will remain available as we transition clients over to the new API Services Portal - [link to old API Keys](https://gwa2.apps.gov.bc.ca)
