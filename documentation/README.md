The BC Government API Management Platform is a common component that serves as a
central entry point for APIs, and acts as an intermediary between applications
and backend services.

If you are a developer or part of a government team, you can administer and
manage your APIs using the [API Services Portal](https://api.gov.bc.ca/). Within
the Portal you can:

- Define, configure, and manage API endpoints to ensure proper connectivity and access
- Set up and manage security measures, including authentication, authorization,
  and access control to protect sensitive data
- Implement and adjust rate limitations to control and optimize API usage
- Monitor API performance, track usage analytics and gather insights to ensure
  optimal functionality and identify potential issues in a usage dashboard
- Manage the different versions as business needs change and make sure the right
  actions are occurring

The [API Directory](https://api.gov.bc.ca/devportal/api-directory) provides a
place to share your API for developers to discover.
