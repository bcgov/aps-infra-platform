The API Program Services (APS) team provides two common components to support
API management and discovery: the API Services Portal and the API Directory.

If you are a developer or part of a government team, you can take advantage of
the [API Services Portal](https://api.gov.bc.ca/) to administer and manage your
APIs. The Portal provides API gateway functionality, creating a central entry
point for APIs, and acting as an intermediary between applications and backend
services. Within the Portal you can:

- Define, configure, and manage API endpoints to ensure proper connectivity and access
- Set up and manage security measures, including authentication, authorization,
  and access control to protect sensitive data
- Implement and adjust rate limitations to control and optimize API usage
- Monitor API performance, track usage analytics and gather insights to ensure
  optimal functionality and identify potential issues in a usage dashboard
- Manage the different versions as business needs change and make sure the right
  actions are occurring

The [API Directory](https://api.gov.bc.ca/devportal/api-directory) provides a
place to share your APIs for developers to discover.
