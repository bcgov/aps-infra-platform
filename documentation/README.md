# Welcome

The BC Government API Management Platform is a common component that serves as a central entry point for APIs, and acts as an intermediary between applications and backend services. 

If you are a developer or part of a government team, you can administer and manage your APIs using the **API Services Portal**. Within the Portal you can: 

•	Define, configure, and manage API endpoints to ensure proper connectivity and access
•	Set up and manage security measures, including authentication, authorization, and access control to protect sensitive data
•	Implement and adjust rate limitations to control and optimize API usage
•	Monitor API performance, track usage analytics and gather insights to ensure optimal functionality and identify potential issues in a usage dashboard
•	Manage the different versions as business needs change and make sure the right actions are occurring

The **API Directory** provides a place to share your API for developers to discover.
