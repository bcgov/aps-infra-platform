title: {Concept Name}

<!-- template preamble -->

A concept page explains some aspect of the API Management Platform. They can be
thought of as extended definitions of major abstractions, such as a resource or
mechanism. Concept pages provide essential background, enabling readers to
understand the Platform, and thereby navigate tasks to achieve their goals.
Typically, concept pages don't include sequences of steps, but instead provide
links to tasks or tutorials.

Considerations for page audience:
- Chunking: Consider dividing the concept page into sections for different audiences.
- Layer depths of explanation: Start with simple explanations for non-technical readers, then progress into detailed technical explanations.
- Split: Consider splitting into multiple documents if audience needs vary greatly.

To write a new concept page, copy this file. All text in {curly brackets} should be replaced or removed.
