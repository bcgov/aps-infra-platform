## Template preamble (remove!)

A concept page explains some aspect of the API Program Services offerings. They
can be thought of as extended definitions of major abstractions, such as a
resource (like Products) or higher-level concept (like an API Gateway) or an
overview of the Platform. Concept pages provide essential background, enabling
readers to understand the Platform, and thereby navigate tasks to achieve their
goals. Typically, concept pages don't include sequences of steps, but instead
provide links to tasks or tutorials.

Considerations for page audience:

- Layer depths of explanation: Start with simple, high-level explanations for
  non-technical readers, then progress into detailed technical explanations.
- If that isn't enough, then consider dividing the concept page into sections
  for different audiences.

To write a new concept page, copy this file. All text in {curly brackets} should
be replaced or removed.

{Then include a paragraph with a definition of the concept you are explaining.
If more definitions are needed, include those definitions here as a bulleted list.}
