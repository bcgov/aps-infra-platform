# API Access

## Use the Access Approval Process

Enable `approval` for an Environment and go through the access request process by requesting access, and playing the role of Access Manager to review the request and approve access.

## Manage Access and Controls

> NOTE: To manage access to your APIs, you must have the `Access.Manage` permission for the Namespace.

As an Access Manager, you can manage the new Consumer by going to the `Namespaces` tab, and selecting `Consumers`.

Here you should see the newly created Consumer. Click on the `name`.

You can administer Controls such as rate limiting and IP restrictions.

You can administer Authorization by toggling access to the particular Product and Environment.
