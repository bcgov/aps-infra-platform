# Our Vision

We believe in the potential of digital technologies to improve services for people. We envision services that seamlessly connect and provide reliable access to information and data precisely when it’s needed.

By unlocking the capabilities of APIs and our platform so that digital innovation can thrive, we can propel BC government’s ability to exchange information and data, adapt quickly to evolving needs, and create cost-effective solutions to complex problems.

This vision is aligned with [BC Gov’s Digital Plan](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/policies-standards/digital-plan/), as well as the [Data Management Policy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/data-management-policy).

# Our Mission

To transform this vision into a reality, we are improving the delivery methods for APIs in the BC government. Our goal is to promote the use of modern APIs and simplify the integration process for both API consumers and providers.

Our primary focus is reducing your infrastructure needs, simplifying technical and administrative complexity, and helping you manage APIs more effectively so that data and information can be exchanged securely and efficiently.

Through these improvements, we aim to create a more streamlined experience for everyone involved in an API ecosystem.

> **“Make integration easier”**
> Our mission is to make integration easier for everyone who wants to connect to applications, systems or services within BC government ministries and across the broader public sector. If you are currently using APIs or exploring connection opportunities for the first time, we are committed to ensuring a simplified journey for you.

To achieve our mission, we are building an API platform – a one-stop shop for all BC Gov APIs, best-in-class guidance and documentation, easy access to help and support, and a streamlined onboarding process.

As we learn from you, we will continue to evolve our vision.

We will iterate based on your feedback - to tell us what you think, please use the feedback widget or contact us.
