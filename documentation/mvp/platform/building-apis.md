# Building government APIs

## Overview

This page explains what’s involved in building APIs for the BC Government, and how our API platform can help.

It applies to anyone who is thinking of building an API with provincial applicability – whether for government Ministries or for a third party.

## Building a good API

There is more to building a good API than you might think - hands-on coding is only around 20% of the work.

Other tasks include:

- writing API documentation
- setting up test environments and test data
- designing and running the ‘onboarding’ process for API consumers
- providing help and support to API consumers
- marketing your API and getting people to use it

Over the years we’ve gathered a lot of feedback on what a good API looks like, primarily from people who are actually building industry software. We’ve incorporated the key points into our [API Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Data-and-APIs/BC-Government-API-Guidelines).

## API platform

Our [API platform](./landing-page) makes building APIs easier, and provides many of the features you need to build a good API, including:

- a cloud-native hosting platform for your API, with plug-and-play security, rate limiting, logging, monitoring and alerting
- an API catalogue where you can publish your API specification
- extensive documentation for API providers, including a step-by-step API delivery process
- technical and non-technical support for API providers, including extensive documentation and a step-by-step delivery process
- a digital onboarding tool for API consumer onboarding

We operate a 'platform' model - you build and run your own API, using our tools and with our help and support.

The API platform is centrally funded - it's free of charge for BC Government API providers. This is subject to a reasonable use policy, and also might change in the future.

## API delivery process

Our API delivery process includes all the steps needed to build and run a good API....
