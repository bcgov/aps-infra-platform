The API Program Services (APS) platform is a secure, stable, highly-available API gateway, management portal and directory that handles more than 2.6 billion API requests per year for B.C. government ministries and third-party applications built on public sector data.

Digital teams that develop applications based on B.C. government APIs can use the platformâ€™s API Directory to easily find and securely request access to the APIs they need.

API providers within the B.C. government can use the full range of APS platform services to:

Manage all of their APIs in a centralized, secure environment.
Configure, test and publish APIs, track usage and other metrics, and enforce API policies across their full life cycle.
Implement comprehensive authentication and security including rate limiting, threat protection, encryption, and third-party authentication.
Support government-standard digital identities for issuing API credentials, such as IDIR and BC Services Card login.
Control their branding and user experience with customizable URLs.

## Why should I use it

### Increases the capacity of digital teams

Reduces your infrastructure needs and streamlines internal processes by allowing your team to use APS for routing traffic to your API endpoints, issue and revoke credentials, enforce rate limiting, and report on service metrics.

### Promotes trusted discovery and use of B.C. government APIs

Digital teams who are building connected services can easily find and request access to integrate with your API through the API directory, and APIs are published behind the authoritative api.gov.bc.ca domain.

### Protects data and simplifies access management

APS provides a consistent approach for APIs that is aligned with B.C. government policy and recommendations. The platform has an in-place Privacy Impact Assessment and Security Threat and Risk Assessment.
